## Wet Food
Note: There were going to be 2 types of canned wet food, but they hated the Renal Care one; so we're doing just Select Protein.
- Split a can of wet food between two metal bowls
## Wet Food in Automated Feeder
- Split a can of food between two metal bowls.
- Add a cube of ice to each bowl on top of the food.
  - The ice keeps the food colder and moist for when they finally eat.
- I use the metal bowls because I don't like them eating out of plastic
## Dry Food
- Put a metal bowl on top of the scale and zero it out
- Fill that bowl with 15 to 16g of kibble
- Repeat with the second bowl.
  - The bowls don't all weigh the same so you need to zero out for both of them
