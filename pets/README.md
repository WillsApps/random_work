# Litter Box

I try to scoop the litter box every morning and afternoon.

Don't worry about being efficient with litter, better to get extra litter into the bag rather than leave something
behind.

## Removing waste

1. Grab a pink plastic bag
2. Use the scooper look around the boxes for dark litter spots or poop
3. Scoop any poop and put it into the bag
4. Scoop any dark litter spots and put it into the bag
    1. They will want to fall apart, so move quickly so it doesn't all just fall through the holes
5. Put some baking powder into the bag
6. Tie the bag
7. Add fresh litter to replace what was removed
8. Take the bag to the trash outside

## Setting up after removal

1. Use the scooper to mix up the litter
2. Push the litter into a pile in the middle of the box
3. Put baking powder on top of the pile
4. Poke the baking powder to get it to mix in a little so they don't track it all over
