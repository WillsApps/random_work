## Wet Food
Note: There were going to be 2 types of canned wet food, but they hated the Renal Care one; so we're doing just Select Protein.
- Split a can of wet food between two metal bowls
## Wet Food in Automated Feeder
- Split a can of food between two metal bowls.
- Add a cube of ice to each bowl on top of the food.
  - The ice keeps the food colder and moist for when they finally eat.
- I use the metal bowls because I don't like them eating out of plastic
## Dry Food
- Put a metal bowl on top of the scale and zero it out
- Fill that bowl with 15 to 16g of kibble
- Repeat with the second bowl.
  - The bowls don't all weigh the same so you need to zero out for both of them

# Litter Box

I try to scoop the litter box every morning and afternoon.

Don't worry about being efficient with litter, better to get extra litter into the bag rather than leave something
behind.

## Removing waste

1. Grab a pink plastic bag
2. Use the scooper look around the boxes for dark litter spots or poop
3. Scoop any poop and put it into the bag
4. Scoop any dark litter spots and put it into the bag
    1. They will want to fall apart, so move quickly so it doesn't all just fall through the holes
5. Put some baking powder into the bag
6. Tie the bag
7. Add fresh litter to replace what was removed
8. Take the bag to the trash outside

## Setting up after removal

1. Use the scooper to mix up the litter
2. Push the litter into a pile in the middle of the box
3. Put baking powder on top of the pile
4. Poke the baking powder to get it to mix in a little so they don't track it all over
